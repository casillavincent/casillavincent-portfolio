This application fetches data from the TMDB Rest API that outputs and updates them realtime onto a  component making it completely dynamic. This is definitely one of the more challenging projects during my time at BCIT, but this project made me fall in love with React and Javascript.",

      design:
         "For our design tools course final project, I created high-fidelity mockups using Photoshop and Adobe XD. Although it’s not identical to the final product, I wanted to keep aspects from my initial design once I started with development. I knew I wanted to have a sidebar, a fixed navigation in mobile view instead of a hamburger maintain the general layout of the mockup. For the basic design, I wanted to use colors that are dark, easy on the eyes and designate one accent color. Considering that the backbone of this project was to create a spin on IMDB and TMDB, I wanted to take layouts that are familiar and make them less crowded.",
      development:
         "Since this would be my first react application, I started building a static webpage using HTML and JSX. I wanted to ensure that the template and architecture was clear as I would be replacing the content with dynamic content. Off the bat, I knew I would be working with a mix between static pages and dynamic pages so I organized my components based on those categories.",

      challenge:
         "The challenging part about this application was fetching data from the TMDB Rest API. This concept was the first time dipping into a bit of backend development. Way before this project’s deadline, I decided to explore concepts of promises, callback functions, the call stack and asynchronous functions. These were by far the most complicated Javascript concepts I came across and began practicing them using setTimeout to mimic fetching data. I later took these concepts and took baby steps until I was able to create a function that would fetch the data asynchronously.",

For this reason, I decided to recreate Discover Japan using React.",

         "When designing this project, I wanted to use the colors associated with the Japanese flag - white and red. My initial live site, I used a lot of rounded corners but later I found that they looked very tacky and outdated. For the React version, I decided to stick with a layout that is more linear and sharp. As a person who watches a lot of anime, I find the Japanese calligraphy very unique and I wanted to incorporate them in my design. I translated the headings into Kanji and placed them underneath and it really makes the webpage more modern.",
